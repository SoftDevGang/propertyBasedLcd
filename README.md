# Kata comparing example based tests with property based tests

## Conclusion

We conclude that we need 14 property based tests for verifying that every combination 
of the layout is correct using a property based tests.

It would be sufficient with one example based tests to verify that every combination
of the layout is correct.

The LCD Kata doesn't seem to lend itself as a good example.

### Usage criteria

Are the properties business oriented and do they give confidence that 
the result is always correct?
